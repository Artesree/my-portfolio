<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I am Artesree. I am an engineering student pursuing my final year course of B.Tech Chemical.
   Apart from that I have quite a knack for learning things that are beyond my field of enginnering
  such as Web Development, mastering artistic strokes. </p>

<p>Speaking of my hobbies, I am an avid reader, I read all kinds of genres ranging from fiction,
  non fiction, mystery, crime and many more.

<p>And what's better than listening to songs while working? Check out my spotify playlist and you'll know me better.</p>
